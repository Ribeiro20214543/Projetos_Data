# Data_Scientist_with_Python

In this repository, you will find exercises performed on the DataCamp Python Data Scientist track. Interactive exercises were performed using the most popular Python libraries including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and more. The exercises did work with real-world datasets to develop statistical and machine learning techniques needed to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP). This trail, prepared by DataCamp, increased my Python skills and was essential in the beginning of my journey towards becoming a confident data scientist.
